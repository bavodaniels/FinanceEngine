# Track Specification: Upgrade Project Infrastructure and Baseline Core TDD

## Overview
This track focuses on modernizing the project's foundational infrastructure and establishing the high-standard testing pattern (100% TDD) defined in the product guidelines.

## Objectives
1.  **Dependency Modernization:** Upgrade the build configuration to Java 25 and Spring Boot 4.0.2.
2.  **Architecture Alignment:** Ensure the existing structure strictly adheres to Hexagonal Architecture principles.
3.  **TDD Foundation:** Implement a baseline trend-following strategy in the `core` module using a port-driven TDD approach to achieve 100% coverage for the new logic.

## Technical Details
- **Java Version:** 25
- **Spring Boot:** 4.0.2
- **Testing:** JUnit 5, AssertJ 3.27.7
- **Database:** PostgreSQL integration preparations.

## Success Criteria
- Project builds successfully with Java 25 and Spring Boot 4.
- `core` module contains a functional strategy skeleton.
- Test coverage for new `core` logic is 100%.
