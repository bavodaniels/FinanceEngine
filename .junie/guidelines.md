# Best Practices for Java 21, Spring Boot, Apache Commons Math, and Spring Data JPA

This document outlines best practices for developing applications using Java 21, Spring Boot, Apache Commons Math, and Spring Data JPA.

## Java 21 Best Practices

* **Leverage New Language Features:**
  * **Record Patterns (JEP 440):** Simplify pattern matching with records, making code more concise and readable for data-oriented classes.
  * **Unnamed Patterns and Variables (JEP 443):** Use `_` for unused variables in `catch` blocks or for unnamed patterns to indicate an ignored value, improving code clarity.
  * **Sequenced Collections (JEP 431):** Utilize the new `SequencedCollection` interface and its sub-interfaces (`SequencedSet`, `SequencedList`, `SequencedMap`) for well-defined element ordering and access.
  * **Virtual Threads (JEP 444):** Employ virtual threads for highly concurrent applications to reduce resource consumption and simplify asynchronous programming. Prefer `Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()` or `Thread.ofVirtual().start()`.
  * **Pattern Matching for Switch (JEP 441):** Enhance `switch` expressions and statements with type patterns, guarding patterns, and `null` handling for more expressive and safe conditional logic.
* **Immutable Data Structures:** Favor immutable objects, especially with records, to improve thread safety and reduce side effects.
* **Functional Programming:** Continue to embrace functional programming paradigms using streams, lambdas, and method references for cleaner, more maintainable code.
* **Module System (JPMS):** If starting a new project, consider using the Java Platform Module System to encapsulate code, enforce strong encapsulation, and improve application startup performance.
* **Garbage Collection:** Understand the default garbage collector (G1 in Java 21) and monitor its performance. Tune GC parameters only if necessary and with careful consideration.
* **JMH for Benchmarking:** Use the Java Microbenchmark Harness (JMH) for accurate performance testing of critical code sections.

## Spring Boot Best Practices

* **Version Management:**
  * Always use a stable and recent version of Spring Boot (e.g., 3.x for Java 21 compatibility).
  * Leverage the Spring Boot parent POM or the Spring Boot Gradle plugin for dependency management to ensure consistent and compatible versions of all Spring-related libraries.
* **Configuration:**
  * **Externalized Configuration:** Store configuration in `application.properties` or `application.yml` files, environment variables, or command-line arguments.
  * **Profiles:** Use Spring profiles to manage environment-specific configurations (e.g., `dev`, `test`, `prod`).
  * **Configuration Properties:** Create type-safe configuration properties using `@ConfigurationProperties` for complex configurations.
* **RESTful API Design:**
  * **Statelessness:** Design REST endpoints to be stateless.
  * **Resource-Oriented URLs:** Use meaningful, plural nouns for resources (e.g., `/users`, `/products`).
  * **HTTP Methods:** Employ appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH) for CRUD operations.
  * **Versioning:** Implement API versioning (e.g., via URL paths `/v1/users` or through custom headers).
  * **Error Handling:** Implement consistent and informative error responses using Spring's `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`.
* **Security:**
  * **Spring Security:** Integrate Spring Security for authentication and authorization.
  * **HTTPS:** Always use HTTPS in production environments.
  * **CSRF Protection:** Enable CSRF protection for web applications.
  * **Input Validation:** Validate all incoming data to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
* **Testing:**
  * **Unit Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests for individual components.
  * **Integration Tests:** Use `@SpringBootTest` for integration tests that load the full application context.
  * **Slicing Tests:** Utilize annotations like `@WebMvcTest`, `@DataJpaTest`, `@JdbcTest` for focused testing of specific layers.
  * **Mocking:** Use Mockito or other mocking frameworks to isolate dependencies during testing.
* **Logging:**
  * **SLF4J/Logback:** Use SLF4J as an abstraction layer with Logback as the implementation for robust logging.
  * **Structured Logging:** Consider structured logging (e.g., JSON format) for easier log analysis.
  * **Appropriate Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) and avoid excessive logging in production.
* **Monitoring and Actuators:**
  * Enable Spring Boot Actuators for production-ready features like health checks, metrics, and environment information.
  * Integrate with monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
* **Database Migrations:** Use Flyway or Liquibase for managing database schema migrations.

## Apache Commons Math Best Practices

* **Choose the Right Module:** Apache Commons Math is extensive. Understand the available modules (e.g., `commons-math3-stat`, `commons-math3-distribution`, `commons-math3-linear`) and select only those you need.
* **Immutability:** Many classes in Apache Commons Math are immutable (e.g., `RealMatrix`, `Complex`). Leverage this for thread safety and predictable behavior.
* **Error Handling:** Be aware of potential exceptions (e.g., `MathArithmeticException`, `DimensionMismatchException`) and handle them gracefully.
* **Numerical Stability:**
  * Understand the limitations of floating-point arithmetic.
  * Use the `Precision` class for floating-point comparisons (`equals`, `compareTo`).
  * When dealing with sums, consider `Sum` or `Mean` classes which can offer better precision for large datasets.
* **Performance Considerations:**
  * For iterative algorithms, consider using the `UnivariateSolver` or `MultivariateSolver` interfaces with appropriate implementations (e.g., `BisectionSolver`, `NewtonRaphsonSolver`).
  * For large matrix operations, be mindful of memory consumption and computational cost.
* **Documentation:** Refer to the official Apache Commons Math documentation for detailed explanations of algorithms and class usage.
* **Statistical Analysis:**
  * Use classes like `DescriptiveStatistics` or `SummaryStatistics` for quick computation of basic statistics on a dataset.
  * For hypothesis testing, explore classes in the `org.apache.commons.math3.stat.inference` package.

## Spring Data JPA Best Practices

* **Entity Design:**
  * **JPA Annotations:** Use standard JPA annotations (`@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`, `@Column`, `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToOne`, etc.) for entity mapping.
  * **Bidirectional Relationships:** Manage bidirectional relationships carefully, ensuring the "owning" side handles the relationship properly (e.g., using `mappedBy` on the inverse side).
  * **Lazy Loading:** Default to lazy loading for relationships (`@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`) to avoid N+1 problems. Fetch eagerly only when necessary.
  * **Equals and HashCode:** Implement `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods consistently for entities, especially when using them in collections or as map keys. Consider using business keys instead of generated IDs for equality.
  * **Auditing:** Use Spring Data JPA's `@CreatedDate`, `@LastModifiedDate`, `@CreatedBy`, `@LastModifiedBy` with `@EnableJpaAuditing` for automatic auditing.
* **Repository Design:**
  * **Interface-Based Repositories:** Define repository interfaces extending `JpaRepository`, `PagingAndSortingRepository`, or `CrudRepository`.
  * **Query Methods:** Leverage Spring Data JPA's query method derivation for simple queries (e.g., `findByLastNameAndFirstName`).
  * **`@Query` Annotation:** Use `@Query` for more complex JPQL or native SQL queries. Prefer JPQL for type safety and database independence.
  * **Custom Repositories:** For highly complex or reusable queries, define custom repository implementations.
  * **Batch Operations:** When performing bulk inserts or updates, consider using JDBC batching or Spring Data JPA's `saveAll()` method, potentially with `@Transactional`.
* **Transactions:**
  * **`@Transactional`:** Use Spring's `@Transactional` annotation for service layer methods that modify data. Understand its propagation behavior and isolation levels.
  * **Read-Only Transactions:** Mark read-only operations with `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` to potentially optimize performance.
* **Performance Optimization:**
  * **Fetch Joins:** Use fetch joins (`LEFT JOIN FETCH`) in JPQL queries to eagerly fetch associated entities and avoid N+1 problems.
  * **`@BatchSize` / `hibernate.default_batch_fetch_size`:** Configure batch fetching for collections to reduce the number of queries.
  * **Projection Interfaces:** Use projection interfaces to fetch only the required columns, rather than entire entities, especially for DTOs.
  * **`findDistinctBy...`:** Use `distinct` in query methods to avoid duplicate results when joining.
  * **Indexing:** Ensure appropriate database indexes are in place for frequently queried columns.
  * **Caching (L2 Cache):** Consider using a second-level cache (e.g., Ehcache, Infinispan) for frequently accessed, rarely changing data.
* **Error Handling:**
  * Catch `EmptyResultDataAccessException` for `findById` when an entity is not found.
  * Handle `OptimisticLockException` when using optimistic locking for concurrency control.
* **Database Migrations:** As mentioned in Spring Boot practices, use Flyway or Liquibase for schema evolution.
* **Testing:**
  * **`@DataJpaTest`:** Use `@DataJpaTest` for testing JPA repositories. It sets up an in-memory database by default, making tests fast and isolated.
  * **Testcontainers:** For more realistic integration tests, use Testcontainers to spin up actual database instances.


## Java Coding Best Practices

* **Readability and Maintainability:**
  * **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive names for variables, methods, classes, and packages. Avoid single-letter names unless for loop counters or very localized contexts.
    * *Bad:* `int x;`, `List l;`, `void doIt();`
    * *Good:* `int customerCount;`, `List<Product> products;`, `void processOrder();`
  * **Consistent Formatting:** Adhere to a consistent code style (e.g., Google Java Style Guide, Oracle Code Conventions). Use an IDE formatter to enforce this.
  * **Keep Methods Small:** Aim for methods that do one thing and do it well. Large methods are harder to understand, test, and maintain.
  * **Avoid Magic Numbers/Strings:** Use named constants (`final static`) for literal values that have special meaning.
  * **Comments:** Write comments to explain *why* certain code exists or *what* complex logic is doing, not just *what* the code literally does. Keep them up-to-date.
  * **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Refactor common code into reusable methods or classes.
* **Object-Oriented Principles:**
  * **Encapsulation:** Keep class fields private and expose them through public methods (getters/setters) only when necessary.
  * **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each class should have only one reason to change.
  * **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** Depend on abstractions, not concretions (e.g., use interfaces instead of concrete classes for dependencies).
  * **Composition Over Inheritance:** Favor composition to reuse functionality, as inheritance can lead to rigid class hierarchies.
* **Error Handling:**
  * **Specific Exceptions:** Throw and catch specific exceptions rather than broad `Exception` or `Throwable`.
  * **Checked vs. Unchecked:** Use checked exceptions for recoverable errors that the caller *must* handle. Use unchecked exceptions (runtime exceptions) for programming errors or unrecoverable situations.
  * **Fail-Fast:** Validate input at the earliest possible point to prevent incorrect state or behavior later.
  * **Resource Management:** Use try-with-resources for automatically closing resources like `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Connection`, etc.
* **Concurrency:**
  * **Immutable Objects:** Prefer immutable objects to reduce the need for synchronization.
  * **`java.util.concurrent`:** Use classes from `java.util.concurrent` (e.g., `ExecutorService`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, `AtomicInteger`) instead of manual synchronization or `Thread` manipulation where possible.
  * **Synchronization:** When using `synchronized` blocks, keep them as small as possible and synchronize on private, final objects or the class itself for static methods.
  * **Volatile:** Understand the `volatile` keyword for ensuring visibility of variable updates across threads, but know it does not provide atomicity.
* **Collections:**
  * **Choose the Right Collection:** Select the appropriate collection interface and implementation based on your needs (e.g., `ArrayList` for dynamic arrays, `LinkedList` for frequent insertions/deletions at ends, `HashSet` for unique elements, `HashMap` for key-value pairs).
  * **Generics:** Always use generics with collections to ensure type safety and avoid `ClassCastException` at runtime.
  * **Immutable Collections:** For collections that should not be modified, use `Collections.unmodifiableList()`, `List.of()`, `Set.of()`, `Map.of()` (Java 9+), or Guava's immutable collections.
* **Performance (General):**
  * **Avoid Premature Optimization:** Optimize only when profiling identifies a bottleneck.
  * **String Concatenation:** Use `StringBuilder` or `StringBuffer` for building strings in loops or when many concatenations are involved.
  * **Stream API Efficiency:** Be mindful of intermediate and terminal operations in streams. Avoid unnecessary boxing/unboxing with primitive streams (`IntStream`, `LongStream`, `DoubleStream`).
* **Security:**
  * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input to prevent injection attacks (SQL, command, XSS).
  * **Secure API Usage:** Use secure versions of APIs (e.g., `SecureRandom` instead of `Random` for cryptographic purposes).
  * **Least Privilege:** Run applications with the minimum necessary privileges.
  * **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan your project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check.
* **IDE Usage:**
  * **Leverage IDE Features:** Utilize your IDE's features like code completion, refactoring tools, static analysis (Linting), and debugging.
  * **Code Templates/Live Templates:** Create and use templates for common code structures.
